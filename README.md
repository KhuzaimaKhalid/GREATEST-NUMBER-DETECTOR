# GREATEST-NUMBER-DETECTOR
This C program finds the greatest of four numbers entered by the user. It prompts the user to input four integers and then determines which of those integers is the largest.

Features
Accepts four integer inputs from the user.
Compares the numbers to find the greatest one.
Displays the greatest number to the user.
How It Works
The program starts by displaying a title message.
It initializes an array to store four integers.
It uses a loop to prompt the user to enter four numbers, storing each input in the array.
The program initializes the greatest variable with the first number in the array.
It then iterates through the array to compare each number with the current greatest value:
If a number is greater than the current greatest, it updates the greatest variable.
Finally, the program outputs the greatest number found.
